Coming up, a New Orleans man says his socks are finally dry.
But first, the big news in entertainment this week
is the lovable child actress, Olivia Fuller.
Oh, my God, Brian, that's Olivia from the performing arts school.
What sort of overblown contract has that dreadful bitch landed now?
Most of you know Olivia as the adorable little girl in the Tasty Juice ads.
Hey, Mom, can I have some soda?
No, but you can have some Tasty Juice. It has only one-third the sugar of soda.
Delicious. Thanks, Mom.

But little Olivia's career may be over just as it begins
with today's announcement that Tasty Juice
will be dropping her as their spokesperson
and replacing her with a new ad campaign
featuring rock'n'roll legend Chuck Berry.
Open your mouth, baby. Here it comes.

But there is a silver lining for local Quahogians,
as Miss Fuller will be appearing at the Quahog mall this weekend
to mark the grand opening of the new Brat Wraps Kids Clothing store.
Oh, that's perfect.
Brian, we have to go down there this weekend and heckle her roundly.
I'll humiliate her worse than Luke Skywalker did to that Rebel pilot.

The exhaust shaft is only two meters wide,
so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.
That's impossible. Even for a computer.
It's not impossible. I used to bull's-eye wamprats in my T-16 back home.
They're not much bigger than two meters.
Hey, uh, can-can I talk to you privately for a second?
Sure.

Th-that, that, uh, that was, that was unnecessary.
What's the problem?
Well, you just kind of called me out in front of everybody back there...
- I was just making a point. - I know, I know, but you like just...
- kind of sandbagged me. - I sandbagged you?
In front of all of our friends, yeah,
- you sandbagged me. - I sandbagged you.
You sandbagged me, yes.
Well, here I am trying to help you with something...
You know what, I don't need your kind of help, all right?
Have a great assault. Jerk.

Lois, I don't understand why I got to sit through a chick flick.
Peter, you promised you'd come with me to see Autumn's Piano.
Besides, you owe me big after the way you embarrassed me in front of Sandra Oh.
Oh, my God, Sandra Oh. We loved you in Sideways.
Thank you.
